# CSVtoJSONXML

- Source code (.java) files are in ~src/CSVtoJSONXML/
- Input and output files are in ~/resources/

Please use the "Periodic Table of Elements.csv" that I have uploaded in resources folder as the one from email had some issues and was not getting parsed completely. Basically its the same file with exactly same content, I just downloaded on my MAC and opened in MS Excel for MAC and clicked save (Accepted the warning that some formatting will be lost).
